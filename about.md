CTO @ [Skipjaq](http://www.skipjaq.com). We optimise your applications using
fancy machine learning cleverness. 

In a past life, I was co-founder of [SpringSource](https://spring.io/) which was
acquired by [VMware](https://www.vmware.com). After SpringSource I spent some
time working in consumer finance as co-founder and CTO of [Bamboo
Loans](https://www.bambooloans.com).
